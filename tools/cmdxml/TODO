TODO List
=========

* See how to remove 'cmdxml.py' and make the package into a simple module file.
  This requires manually declaring 'items' which would allow it to be used as
  a pytest package.
* Maybe change the fixture to be an 'executor' class to include the shell
  configuration.
* When 'cmdxml.py' is not needed anymore, declare as a pytest plugin
  It will then not need to be imported anymore
  It should be loaded a as plugin in the command line only when not installed
* Rename the '_execute_command' functions to something nice
  as they are displayed in the output on errorâ€¦
* Test in real cases
* Implement URLS
* Verify there are not existing solutions
* TESTS TESTS TESTS ! ;) (tox ?)
